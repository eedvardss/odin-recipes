    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chopped chicken (chicken tikka) in a spiced sauce (masala). 
        The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The origins of the dish are debated, with many believing it was created by South Asian cooks in Britain. 
        It is offered at restaurants around the world and is similar to butter chicken. Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and 
        yoghurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy sauce. A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 
        48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce 
        and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato purée or with food dye. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the 
        method of creation and appearance.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>yogurt</li>
        <li>cream</li>
        <li>tomato</li>
        <li>onion</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>ginger</li>
        <li>chili pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken: In a large mixing bowl, combine boneless chicken thighs, plain yogurt, minced garlic, grated ginger, garam masala, turmeric, ground cumin, Kashmiri chili powder, and salt. Mix everything well until the chicken is evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it marinate for at least 10 minutes. For optimal flavor infusion, marinate for 1 hour or overnight in the refrigerator</li>
        <li>Sear The Chicken Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. This will be your one-pan method for the Chicken Tikka Masala. Once hot, add the marinated chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding, which allows for proper searing and prevents steaming. Sear the chicken pieces for about 3 minutes on each side until they are nicely browned. Once browned, transfer the chicken to a plate and cover it to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Make the Tikka Masala Sauce: In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium and add unsalted butter. Allow it to melt, add finely diced onions to the butter. Sauté the onions for about 3-5 minutes until they turn translucent and start to caramelize. Stir in additional grated garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for an additional minute, making sure not to burn the garlic and ginger. Add garam masala, ground cumin, turmeric, and ground coriander to the pan. Cook spices for about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Combine the Sauce Ingredients: Pour in tomato puree or crushed tomatoes. Mix well to combine with the sautéed onions and spices. This tomato base is a fundamental part of your homemade Chicken Tikka Masala sauce. Season with Kashmiri chili powder (to taste) for added color and heat, along with salt. Let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until it thickens and darkens in color, developing that typical rich, Indian curry flavor.</li>
        <li>Add Cream and Chicken: Once the sauce has thickened, stir in heavy cream. This creamy element is what makes your Chicken Tikka Masala luxurious. Add the seared chicken back into the sauce, along with any juices that collected on the plate. Gently stir to coat the chicken in the creamy sauce. Cover the skillet and let it simmer on medium heat for an additional 8-10 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a splash of water to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Final Touches and Serving: Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed—feel free to add more salt or sugar as per your taste. Remove from heat and garnish your Chicken Tikka Masala with freshly chopped cilantro for an extra burst of flavor. Serve your Chicken Tikka Masala hot with sides of steaming basmati rice, buttery garlic naan bread, or  flatbread. for the ultimate Indian meal experience.</li>
