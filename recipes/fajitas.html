    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A fajita, in Tex-Mex cuisine, is any stripped grilled meat, optionally served with stripped peppers and onions usually served on a flour or corn tortilla. 
        The term originally referred to skirt steak, the cut of beef first used in the dish.Popular alternatives to skirt steak include chicken and other cuts of beef, 
        as well as vegetables instead of meat. In restaurants, the meat is usually cooked with onions and bell peppers. Popular condiments include shredded lettuce, sour cream, 
        guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, refried beans, and diced tomatoes. "Tacos de arrachera" is applied to the northern Mexican variant of the dish. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken. Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides of the chicken and use your fingers to press it in.</li>
        <li>Sear the chicken. Lightly coat your skillet with oil and sear the chicken breasts on each side for 7 to 8 minutes. Then remove them from the pan and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing them into strips. </li>
        <li>Saute the bell peppers and onion. While the chicken is cooking, slice the bell peppers and onions. Then saute them in the same skillet for a few minutes until caramelized. You’re essentially making fajita veggies!</li>
        <li>Mix everything and serve. Slice the chicken into thin strips and add them back into the skillet. You can also slice those strips in half again if they’re too thick. Add a squeeze of fresh lime juice on top, and stir everything together before serving.</li>
    </ol>
