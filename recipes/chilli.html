    <h1>Chilli Con Carne</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chili con carne[a] ,often shortened to chili, is a spicy stew of Mexican origin containing chili peppers (sometimes in the form of chili powder), meat (usually beef), tomatoes, 
        and often pinto beans or kidney beans. Other seasonings may include garlic, onions, and cumin. The types of meat and other ingredients used vary based on geographic and personal tastes. 
        Recipes provoke disputes among aficionados, some of whom insist that the word chili applies only to the basic dish, without beans and tomatoes. Chili con carne is a common dish for 
        cook-offs, and may be used as a side, garnish, or ingredient in other dishes, such as soups or salsas. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chilli Peppers</li>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Kidney Beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beef cube: You can sub the water with 2 cups beef broth and skip the bouillon cube but will need to ensure you cook for long enough to reduce down.</li>
        <li>Spiciness – Chili is supposed to be hot! Use 1 tsp cayenne pepper for a warm hum, 1.5 tsp for a nice tingle, or 2 tsp for medium spiciness. Best way is to start with less then add more at the end.</li>
        <li>SLOW COOKER: This is spectacular made in the slow cooker. Just follow the steps in the recipe up to Step 4 using only 1/4 cup of water then tip everything into the slow cooker. Cook it for 6 hours on low in the slow cooker. Even 8 hours will be fine.</li>
        <li>Serving suggestions: The two most common ways to serve as a meal are: Ladle into bowls and serve with Toppings of choice, corn chips or tortillas for dunking (or try this Easy Soft Flatbread); Over rice with Toppings</li>
        <li>Toppings: Sour cream and grated cheese (both mandatory in my world), coriander/cilantro leaves, sliced green onions, diced red onion, Pico de Gallo, Diced avocado, sliced jalapeño or other chillies.</li>
    </ol>
